#News App

It specializes in showing topics such as Sports, Tech, and Science, and includes a search feature for finding articles on any topic.

Additionally, the app offers a dark mode for comfortable reading at night and a web-view feature for viewing articles in full.

To build the app, I used an API with Dio and implemented Bloc state management with Cubit.
